A quick overview:

 1. Replace placeholders in mta.yaml
 2. Deploy app
 3. Make sure that the workflow service permissions (WorkflowInitiator etc.) are assigned
 4. Create a destination using the app-router of this mta
 5. Integrate the tiles in "real" launchpad / portal using screenshots from the folder "screenshots" and using the destination from step 4.
